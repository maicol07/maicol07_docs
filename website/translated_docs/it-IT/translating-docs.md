As you may know, we offer community-crowded translations, which means that our translations are made by community users like you. So, how can you become a translator? You need to follow some steps in order to start translating a project.

## 1. Sign up on the translation platform
You need to sign up and get an account in our [Crowdin page](https://maicol07.crowdin.com/maicol07-docs).

## 2. Select a project and accept the agreement
Once you have signed up and logged in, you can click on Translate.

## 3. (Optional) Translator badge
If you want to get all the news and updates about translating the projects or just talk about this in our community, you can request access to translators "Translators Space", a reserved community category dedicated only to translators.
