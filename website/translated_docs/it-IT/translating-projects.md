Se sei venuto qui dalla rete, vuoi diventare uno dei nostri traduttori. Come potresti sapere, offriamo traduzioni della community, il che significa che le nostre traduzioni sono effettuate da utenti della community come te. Quindi, come puoi diventare un traduttore? Devi seguire alcuni passi per iniziare a tradurre un progetto.

## 1. Iscriviti alla piattaforma di traduzione
You need to sign up and get an account in our [Translation platform](https://translate.maicol07.it).

![Sign up](../../img/translators_guide_signup.png)

## 2. Select a project and accept the agreement
Once you have signed up and logged in, go to the home page of the translation platform and find the project you want to translate. Click on it and you will see a yellow box. This means that to start translating a project you need to accept project agreement to start. Do it and you're ready to go!

## 3. Select a secondary language
The next step is selecting one or more secondary languages. Source strings are in Italian, so you need to see in another language if you don't understand Italian.

Let's try to set English as our secondary language.
1. Go to Your account â†’ Settings at the top-right corner of the page (see image for reference). ![Secondary language: Accessing to account settings](../../img/translators_guide_secondary_language_1.png)
2. Select all English variants in the Secondary language section (this is valid for English and other languages too. Select languages you understand that you will be seen above source string) ![Secondary language: Setting secondary languages](../../img/translators_guide_secondary_language_2.png)

## 4. Start translating!
You're now ready to start translating a project! Select one and enjoy your time with our translation platform!

## 5. (Optional) Translator badge
If you want to get all the news and updates about translating the projects or just talk about this in our community, you can request access to translators "Translators Space", a reserved community category dedicated only to translators.
