This guide will show you how to enable 2FA authentication in your account in Maicol07's Network.

## 1. Go to the settings page
First, you want to login and go to your account settings. Click on your account image on the top-right corner of the screen and select Settings.

## 2. Enable 2FA: 1st step
Once you have reached Settings page, you'll need to scroll until you see 2FA authentication section. Click on Enable: a popup will appear with detailed instructions (reported below)
Download [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) for your preferred device (Desktop or phone) and OS (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, iOS)

## 3. Enable 2FA: 2nd step
Once you have installed Authy, you need to configure it following the app instructions. Then, you'll need to enter your phone number (the one registered in Authy) into the popup.

*Please note that your phone number will only be used for 2FA and not for any other scope*

## 4. Enable 2FA: 3rd step
A notify will now appear in your phone (or any other devices with Authy installed). Click on it and enter into the popup the code displayed

## 5. Finished!
Your account now is secured with 2FA! Your 2FA code will now be requested all the times you'll login (also with OAuth).

<small>Note: Your 2FA code changes every 20 seconds, for security reasons</small>
