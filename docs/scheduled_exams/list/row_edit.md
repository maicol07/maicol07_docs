In this guide you will learn how to edit a row of your list.

1. If you click on a classroom in your dashboard, you will go to the
   classroom page. Here you will see created lists on the left and
   classroom info. Click on the list.
2. You'll see an EDIT button (the one with a pencil icon) at the end of
   the row in the table. Click it and a dialog will appear.
3. Enter the info requested by the form. Some of these are optional,
   such as the exam date. When you have finished click on "OK" to add
   the row to the table.
4. The row should be edited now.
