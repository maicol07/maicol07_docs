In this guide you will learn how to edit a classroom.

1. If you click on a classroom in your dashboard, you will go to the
   classroom page. Here you will see created lists on the left and
   classroom info on the right.
2. Click the "EDIT" button on the right (at the end of the card) to
   enable "Edit mode". You can edit the name, the description and even
   the image (click on the image while you are in "Edit mode" and then
   upload a new one), along with all the other fields you see.
3. To save all the changes you have to click the "SAVE" button that
   appeared when you have enabled the edit mode
